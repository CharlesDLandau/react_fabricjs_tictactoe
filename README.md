## react_fabricjs_tictactoe

### Motivation
Some projects I've been working on use React and [FabricJS](http://fabricjs.com) but I haven't found an established pattern for making them work together. Building a simple
Tic-Tac-Toe component lets me demo the pattern I've settled on so far. If I adopt a better pattern I could use this repo to demo that transition.

### What is Tic-Tac-Toe?
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game where the goal for each of two players is to form a row, column, or diagonal of their shape across a 3x3 grid. Each player can claim one position on the grid each turn and they alternate turns, and positions are claimed by writing the symbol of that player.

### TODO:

Improve README, docs. Improve UI. Establish CONTRIBUTING.md, CI, dockerize, publish to NPM, and so much more. I hope I get to some of that.
